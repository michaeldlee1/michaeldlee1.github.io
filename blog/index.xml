      <description>Over the past week, I have set out with the goal to make a Twitter &amp;ldquo;bot&amp;rdquo; that can create orginal (hopefully comedic) joke tweets.
The first step in this process was to generate a corpus of tweets to train my model off of. I chose six of the comedy twitter accounts I personally follow, as well as my own and my friend&amp;rsquo;s twitter, and downloaded around 10,000 tweets from each (my friend and I only have ~200 tweets each so I just downloaded all of ours) into their own individual csv files.</description>
